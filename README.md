# Solar Power Generation Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts solar power generation using machine learning models based on weather and environmental parameters. Multiple regression models were implemented and compared to identify the best performing algorithm.

---

## Models Implemented
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Adam Optimizer based model
